# OpenTac

OpenTac is a "bring your own X" style framework providing a three-address-code
implementation without a specific frontend language or a backend architecture
in mind.

OpenTac does however high-level provide optimizations on its own internal 
representation. (NOTE: optimizations have not been implemented yet.)

It's your go-to middle-end for all your compiler needs, whether you're building
a JIT compiler, an AOT compiler or even an outright bytecode interpreter.
